# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project for detecting credit card fraud using supervised algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and XGBoost. The project is based on a real-world anonymized dataset containing credit card transactions made by European cardholders. It tackles the challenge of severe class imbalance, applying preprocessing, model tuning, and evaluation using metrics suited for fraud detection.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing & Scaling
- Handling Class Imbalance
- Model Training: KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Model Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1, MCC

## Dataset
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains anonymized credit card transactions.
